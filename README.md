<!--TOC-->

Cache all Docker images whether built or pulled by
[saving](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/) them on
cache misses and
[loading](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/) them on
cache hits. Note that this action does not perform Docker layer caching.
[The official Docker build push action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action)
performs Docker layer caching for built images but does not cache pulled images.

## Usage

- Add the following step before your first use of Docker:

```yaml
- name: Cache Docker images.
  uses: ScribeMD/docker-cache@0.1.2
  with:
    key: docker-${{ runner.os }}-${{ hashFiles(...) }}
```

## Inputs

### Required

#### `key`

The explicit cache key to ferry to the
[official GitHub cache action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
`restore-keys` are not supported, because partial cache restoration leads to a
["snowball" effect](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/do-not-let-npm-cache-snowball/).

## Outputs

### `cache-hit`

The ferried output of the
[official GitHub cache action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache).
True on cache hit (even if the subsequent
[`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/)
failed) and false on cache miss. See also
[skipping steps based on cache-hit](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cache#Skipping-steps-based-on-cache-hit).

## Supported Runners

Please refer to
[`README.md` of ScribeMD/rootless-docker](https://github.com/ScribeMD/rootless-docker#supported-runners).

## Changelog

Please refer to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
